BI-RADS assessment: 1 to 5 (ordinal)  \n","   2. Age: patient's age in years (integer)\n","   3. Shape: mass shape: round=1 oval=2 lobular=3 irregular=4 (nominal)\n","   4. Margin: mass margin: circumscribed=1 microlobulated=2 obscured=3 ill-defined=4 spiculated=5 (nominal)\n","   5. Density: mass density high=1 iso=2 low=3 fat-containing=4 (ordinal)\n","   6. Severity: benign=0 or malignant=1 (binominal)\n","   \n","BI-RADS is an assesment of how confident the severity classification is; it is not a \"predictive\" attribute and so we will discard it. The age, shape, margin, and density attributes are the features that we will build our model with, and \"severity\" is the classification we will attempt to predict based on those attributes.\n","\n","Although \"shape\" and \"margin\" are nominal data types, which sklearn typically doesn't deal with well, they are close enough to ordinal that we shouldn't just discard them. The \"shape\" for example is ordered increasingly from round to irregular.\n","\n","A lot of unnecessary anguish and surgery arises from false positives arising from mammogram results. If we can build a better way to interpret them through supervised machine learning, it could improve a lot of lives.\n","\n","## Your assignment\n","\n","Build a Multi-Layer Perceptron and train it to classify masses as benign or malignant based on its features.\n","\n","The data needs to be cleaned; many rows contain missing data, and there may be erroneous data identifiable as outliers as well.\n","\n","Remember to normalize your data first! And experiment with different topologies, optimizers, and hyperparameters.\n","\n","I was able to achieve over 80% accuracy - can you beat that?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WwMeBmckubCM"},"source":["## Let's begin: prepare your data\n","\n","Start by importing the mammographic_masses.data.txt file into a Pandas dataframe (hint: use read_csv) and take a look at it."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":393,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":603,"status":"ok","timestamp":1637156191123,"user":{"displayName":"Delmond Bongha","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhaAHsAVmF5lfL3Clbe34YWStdw8IQo8TC1qjc99A=s64","userId":"13365223798120040196"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"bVJoeCXzubCN"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <th>67</th>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <th>5.1</th>\n","      <th>3.1</th>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>43</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>?</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>58</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>28</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>74</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>?</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>65</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>?</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>955</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>47</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>956</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>56</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>957</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>64</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>958</th>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>66</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>959</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>62</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>960 rows Ã— 6 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["     5  67  3 5.1 3.1  1\n","0    4  43  1   1   ?  1\n","1    5  58  4   5   3  1\n","2    4  28  1   1   3  0\n","3    5  74  1   5   ?  1\n","4    4  65  1   ?   3  0\n","..  ..  .. ..  ..  .. ..\n","955  4  47  2   1   3  0\n","956  4  56  4   5   3  1\n","957  4  64  4   5   3  0\n","958  5  66  4   5   3  1\n","959  4  62  3   3   3  0\n","\n","[960 rows x 6 columns]"]},"execution_count":393,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import numpy as np \n","import pandas as pd \n","\n","mm = pd.read_csv(\"mammographic_masses.data\")\n","mm\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dbHvi4NfubCO"},"source":["Make sure you use the optional parmaters in read_csv to convert missing data (indicated by a ?) into NaN, and to add the appropriate column names (BI_RADS, age, shape, margin, density, and severity):"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":394,"metadata":{"id":"St7CVwjoubCO"},"outputs":[],"source":["columns = ['BI-RADS assessment', 'Age', 'Shape', 'Margin', 'Density', 'Severity']\n","mm_dataset = pd.read_csv('mammographic_masses.data', names = columns, na_values=['?'])\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nD0ke-tzubCP"},"source":["Evaluate whether the data needs cleaning; your model is only as good as the data it's given.
